TODO
====

* Look into using Hike and other useful gems to cut down the code size
* Rewrite Server spaghetti code; pull out Asset into its own explicit class
* Rethink the top-level concepts that will be exposed. Is Conversion the right way to go?
* Tests!
* Async recompilation
* Application helpers: `javascript_asset "name_of_asset"`
* Move the `conversions_used` concept into Conversion
